Forecasting Bike Rental Demand Using Machine Learning and Weather Data
Project Overview:

Bike sharing systems have become increasingly popular as a convenient means of transportation in cities worldwide. These systems automate the process of renting bicycles through a network of kiosks, allowing users to rent and return bikes as needed. With over 500 bike-sharing programs globally, the data generated by these systems presents a valuable opportunity for research.

This project focuses on leveraging historical usage patterns and weather data to forecast hourly bike rental demand. By analyzing factors such as the duration of travel, departure and arrival locations, and elapsed time, we aim to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the demand for bike rentals at different times of the day.

The goal is to provide insights that can help bike-sharing operators optimize their inventory management, anticipate peak demand periods, and improve overall service efficiency. By harnessing the power of data analytics and machine learning, we strive to enhance the usability and effectiveness of bike sharing systems, contributing to the advancement of urban mobility research.
